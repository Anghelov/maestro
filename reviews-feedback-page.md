# Positive restaurant eating experience

1. Excellent eating experience.. from walking in the door and being greeted by employee, seated and drink order taken, was maybe 5 minutes. Meal was served hot and excellent taste. Server was very friendly and helpful.
2. Great food at a great price! Love the fish plates as well as the salads. Chain restaurant that doesn't feel like a chain! Love this place!
3. Stopped here for a snack on our way back to the Manchester airport. Had the boneless buffalo wings and potato skins appetizer and some French onion soup. Appetizer was very good - wings spicy but not too spicy and the potato skins were excellent. Courtney our server was excellent and friendly, knowledgeable. Would stop in again if in the area. It's a chain but pretty good - better than most. Prices very reasonable.
4. Stopped in for dinner. Food was very good and reasonably priced. Ordered a steak dinner. It was tender and well seasoned. 
5. Very busy restaurant but great service. Great $9.99 meals. Take out option is great deal for quick dinners too.
6. This place is always crowded but there is usually room at the bar. It would never be my first choice but the service is very good and sometimes the food is too.
