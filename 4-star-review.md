# 5 Star Review

## Wilmington Delaware

The restaurant itself doesn't blow you away and it's not a dine dining one, but the atmosphere it's very cozy and it makes you feel really comfortable. I really enjoyed the time spend there and the service was good! Indeed they don't fill your glass once you finished it, but other than that they were very prompt in the rest. I have to admit that there were some details in the restaurant that bothered me, small details like some scratched tables etc, BUT the food was really good. Yes, it's expensive, but I was very satisfied with the food...So the food was very nice cooked, it had flavor, the meat was cooked absolutely perfectly and had savour. If you are a foundue fan, they have a variaty of foundue cheeses and they also have chocolate foundue with fresh fruits. I really was impressed by the food and I left the restaurant very satisfied with the overall experience and I think that's what it matters.
