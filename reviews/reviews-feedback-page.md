4. Stopped in for dinner. Food was very good and reasonably priced. Ordered a steak dinner. It was tender and well seasoned. <br>
5. Very busy restaurant but great service. Great $9.99 meals. Take out option is great deal for quick dinners too. <br>
6. This place is always crowded but there is usually room at the bar. It would never be my first choice but the service is very good and sometimes the food is too. <br>
