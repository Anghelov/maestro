# 5 Star Review
## Mazkeret Batya 
Absolutely lovely dinner with an excellent recommendation for the main course: lamb. Appetizer was also #perfect: beef tartar made in front of us by chef Gabriel Pestana... Wine pairing was awesome, lamb was cooked to perfection and desert surprisingly different: orange parfait. Waiters were friendly, always present. Highly recommended 
Thank you, chef Gabriel Pestana!<br>
