# 3 Star Review
## Mincu Alexandru 
I was out for a stroll around Old Town on a sunny afternoon looking to have a snack or a dessert in a cozy friendly atmosphere. The hostess was friendly and welcoming so I decided to give Belviso a try. It was relatively quiet and they only had a few tables with what appeared to be one waitress working. I had the pancakes with chocolate along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was okay. The service was nothing special. The environment was okay. It was average. The server could have been nicer. Their card machine didn't work although I knew my card worked. The waitress asked if I had cash. I paid up and left. The hostess cheerily thanked me and said goodbye.<br>
