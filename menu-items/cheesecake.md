-Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers.
 The main, and thickest layer, consists of a mixture of soft, fresh
cheese (typically cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there is
a bottom layer, it often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies
(or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.s It may 
be baked or unbaked (usually refrigerated).
